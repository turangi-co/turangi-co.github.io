description: Understanding a 3D scene is quite difficult, specially when it involves working around thin wires, transparent objects as well as ignoring noise selectively to reduce false positives. We have years of experience in developing mixed classiscal and neural solutions for a variety of use cases. (Image credits: Daniel Lu, CC BY 4.0)
